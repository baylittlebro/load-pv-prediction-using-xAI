# Load_PV_Prediction_Using_XAi

The project aims to predict electricity generation and load per hour in Toronto using **LSTM** Recurrent neural networks.
**XAI (eXplainable AI)**, a machine learning library designed with AI explanation potential as the core, is also used. XAI was used for analysis and evaluation of data and models, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used among XAI models.
